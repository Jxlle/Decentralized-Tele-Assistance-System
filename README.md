# Short description of TAS
The Tele Assistance System (TAS) is based on technology services for elderly and chronic sick people that provide care and reassurance needed to allow them to remain living in their own homes. The potential of technology-based services to improve the quality of live of the people with needs and reduce the cost for care has widely been accepted amongst academics and practitioners. There is a huge market potential for these technologies, however, the adoption is hampered by several societal and technological barriers. Key technical factors are reliability, safety, and interoperability, and this is where research on self-adaptation can contribute.

TAS is an exemplar of a service-based system (SBS). SBSs are widely used in e-commerce, online banking, e-health and many other applications. In these systems, services offered by third-party providers are dynamically composed into workflows delivering complex functionality. SBSs increasingly rely on self-adaptation to cope with the uncertainties associated with third-party services, as the loose coupling of services makes online reconfiguration feasible.

# DTAS, this version
This version of TAS has been reworked to support multiple entities in a decentralized system with decision making between the entities.
