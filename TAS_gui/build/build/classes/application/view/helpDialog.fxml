      <TextArea editable="false" layoutX="10.0" layoutY="383.0" prefHeight="300.0" prefWidth="380.0" text="Panels&#10;&#10;The left panel shows the input profile that can be used to test the loaded configuration (i.e., workflow with available concrete services).   A green mark means that the profile is available but currently not executed; a red mark means the profile is executing. The glasses symbols allow inspecting the input profiles and adapting the parameters dynamically. Both a text and table for are available. The green triangle buttons on the right hand side are used to run the corresponding input profile (parallel runs are not supported). Clicking the red mark stops the execution of the running input profile.&#10;&#10;The right panel shows three graphs with tables. When the execution of the input profile completes, the results will be shown in the graphs and overview tables. The Reliability graph shows on the X-axis the series of invocations of the assistance service and on the Y-axis the concrete services that were invoked. Short green vertical lines indicate that invocations were successfully; longer red vertical lines indicate failed invocations. The Performance graph shows on the X-axis the invocations of the assistance service and on the Y-axis the response time of the concrete services that were invoked. The subsequent service executions are represented with stocked collared bars. Finally, the Cost graph shows the accumulated cost for the invocations performed by the input profile. The tables summarize the results.&#10;&#10;TAS Experimention bar  &#10;&#10;The Open button allows opening new input profiles (Open Profile item), open the results of an earlier run stored in csv format (Open Available Services item), and open the log (Open Log). For the latter, log items can be ordered based on different criteria and the log can be filtered based on time and type. &#10;&#10;The Save button allows saving the results of a run (Save Run) as a csv file, the current log (Save Log) as a csv file, the graph of the current reliability chart in png format (Save Reliability Graph), the graph of the current performance chart in png format, and the graph of the current cost chart in png format (Save Cost Graph).&#10;&#10;The buttons No Adaptation and Simple Adaptation allow you to select between execution of services invocations without and with adaptation. Simple Adaptation removes failed services from the set of available services.&#10;&#10;The progress bar shows the progress of an ongoing execution of an input profile." wrapText="true" />
